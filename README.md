Personal Website. Thanks to Quarto 

Check out the site [here](https://sworley1.github.io/)! 

Notes to Sam:

* `.nojekyll` tells GitHub Pages not to do additional processing of your published site using Jekyll
* to publish: run the `quarto publish` command in terminal. Be sure to not be on the `gh-pages` branch and in the root folder
